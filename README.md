# File-Data-Organizer
A tool that helps you organize your file data using Java Swing, basic data structures, and efficient sorting algorithms.

## Mission:
In our current data-driven society, more data has been collected in the past three years than in all of humanity combined. We are blessed (and sometimes cursed) to have access to countless information at our fingertips. This data is, however, more often than not in eggregious clutter that is too confusing to look at and to jumbled to make sense of. For this reason, being able to organize data by categoization of each of its variables is key to visualizing data sets. This program offers users the ability to:

- Sort data by **ascending** order of any variable
- Sort data by **descending** order of any variable
- Exclude or include data based the start or ending characters of any variable
